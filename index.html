                <p> This is a really interesting article about how and why we are able to remember how to perform tasks
                  on both complicated software and easy software. This helps us understand the role of mental models in
                  User experience design, and why natural mapping matters so much.

                <p> Similar to Jane Jacobs “Death and Life of American Cities” this paper echoes an important theme for
                  my paper, that there is a relationship between how something is designed, and who it is designed for.
                  And the genius of Le Corbusier, and Venturi was their insistence that organism and machine should work
                  in harmony, and sustain themselves.

                  form. MIT press, 1977.</p>
                <p> This is the book that inspired this thesis, it is a dense review of 1950s architectural norms and
                  practices. Not everything in the book is relevant to my thesis, but the areas that overlap with
                  software design, design thinking, and agile are really useful. Venturi and Scott brown explore what
                  makes a city useful, and laid out the frameworks for modern Design Thinking.

                </p>
                <p> This paper lays out a theoretical framework for creating layouts that respond and improve the more a
                  user uses them (think the facebook timeline), they also explore why this would be useful. I disagree
                  with their findings, but their framework is actually really useful.

            <p class="mb-5">This week I had a bit of an epiphany. I’ve been having a hard time merging what i am
              interested in learning about (urbanism and design thinking) with what I am interested in building (AR and
              webXR). Originally I wanted to build some kind of geocaching game/app, that merged the principles of
              design thinking from Learning From Las Vegas and showcased how organic and changing of a city NY is. I
              also wanted to do Geocaching because it showcased the idea that user feedback within an application
              legitimizes that software. But as you can see, there wasn't a lot to go on, and I wasn't really excited
              about that idea as a prototype.<br><br>

              But I came across two really cool and interesting videos:<br>

              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llf2IRUsTU0&feature=youtu.be">AR Architecture Example -
                Video</a><br>

              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIuqJWcSKxc">MIT Augmented City - Video</a><br>
              <br>
              And then after a conversation with the only urban planner and architect I know, my dad, (yes I know I need
              more stakeholders) I realized that prototyping is a big problem for city planners, in fact it isnt really
              possible. He described the process of researching zoning laws, and deciding how designs will affect the
              residents of your proposed development as partly going to the library, and partly guess work. This process
              actually antithetical to what people like DSB or David Kelly would want.
              <br><br>
              So my idea now is to create a card sorting exercise, that allows users to build a city with playing cards,
              and see that city come alive in AR</p>

                  works for
                  their artistic and skillful values, but it is important to view his works critically as well because
                  they
                  represent one of the greatest faux pas designers make today. On the one hand, he was a master
                  designer, his
                  buildings and urban planning are arguably some of the most beautiful ever to have been to designed in
                  the
                  20th century. He was infatuated with the idea of designing buildings that didn&#39;t just look good,
                  but
                  worked well with the environment that they were built in. &nbsp;This architect, with no formal
                  education,
                  came up with many concepts that we still reference Today in user experience design. This includes the
                  concepts of modularity in design and organic design. &nbsp;While talking about the machine for living,
                  He
                  even wrote about design that would welcome advancing technology by working symbiotically with machines
                  and
                  people. In design thinking talk, it was clear that he was a champion for Designing for the user. all
                  of
                  this, however, is in sharp contrast with the fact that he never talked to the user, But instead drew
                  from
                  his own experience and intuition.</span></p>

                  city, Las Vegas, seemed to defy the assumptions that many Modernist had previously made, and offered a

                  National Historic Landmark. However, in the late 1950s, architects were debating whether it should be
                  torn
                  down, and replaced with something sleek, modern and concrete. Knocking down the old to make way for

              </h2>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">In the context of urban planning, up until now, we have been talking about
                  how
                  architects have imagined cities should be designed from the ground up. In reality, however, the vast
                  majority of developments have to work within the constraints of what already exists. In the course of
                  human
                  history, very few cities have been built from a clean slate, this includes Chandigarh and Brasilia.
                  Urban
                  planners in 2019 need to consider a variety of factors that exist within the neighborhoods and
                  environment
                  within which they are designing. </span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Urban planning does not happen within the control of one person either
                  there are
                  several job titles that we can break urban planning down into.</span></p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Because City development it&#39;s so depending upon economic and
                  governmental
                  decision-making we will start from the top and work our way down.</span></p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;In many states, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release an
                  Economic Report
                  to the Governor outlining the demand for housing, employment and the projected growth from within a
                  state.
                  Zoning offices within cities rely heavily on directions from the state when deciding how to zone for
                  use.</span></p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">In Utah for example, this economic report shows there is a shortage of
                  about 75,000
                  homes. Meaning that there will be about 75,000 more homebuyers on the market than there are homes,
                  driving
                  up the demand on housing. Cities, though their zoning offices, can then plan for the higher demand in
                  homes,
                  by adjusting their master plan (usually updated every 10 years) to include more residential housing.
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If you are a landowner, interested in developing your land, what you can
                  build
                  depends on this master plan, and what use this land has been zoned for. If your land was zoned for
                  commecial
                  use, and there was economic incentive to build commercial real estate, you would hire a civil engineer
                  to
                  work with the city to develop planning documents to show your proposed use.</span></p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">If that plan meets zoning requirements, they will issues conditions of
                  approval that
                  state what the instructor needs to be approved in order to facilitate the project. If you want to
                  develop
                  your land for something other than what zoning has approved, you would have to hire civil engineeers
                  to do a
                  genral plan adjustment or land swap. THough this is hard and costly to do. </span></p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Throughout this whole process, economic factors, more than design factors
                  drive
                  growth. So to answer the question &ldquo;how do Urban planners ideate and prototype in 2019&rdquo; the
                  answer is pretty simple, they don&rsquo;t.</span></p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
              <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The position within this network that is given the most descretion in what
                  will be
                  built, is the local zoning office, they have more power over will be built than even the state.
                  &nbsp;The
                  urban planners within these offices reference zoning ordinances passed by their city councils, and
                  they
                  reference libraries that help them calcutlate traffic congestion, or the amenities that they can
                  support.
                  They then prototype in AutoCAD, which is simply a Computer Aided Drafting software, that can run basic
                  calculations.</span></p>
